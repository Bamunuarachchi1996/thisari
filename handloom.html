                                Handloom textile weaving is primarily a home culture or based on a community industry. There are two main identified groups of traditional Sri Lankan weavers; the indigenous weaving communities in areas like Thalagune and master weavers brought from India by royalty to make gold-woven handlooms. Traditionally, Sri Lankaâ€™s indigenous weavers have maintained a different aesthetic, where their patterns and colors tend to be more restrained.
