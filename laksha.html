                                Laksha, lac or lacquer work can be described as the most attractive and unique of Sri Lankan handicrafts. dating back to the time of the introduction of Buddhism to the island.

                            Having been introduced during the early days of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Laaksha handicrafts have a special connection with the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, dating back to the times of the country’s monarchy. Over the centuries, many window frames, poles, flag poles, and ‘Sesath’ poles used during the annual Esala Perahera or procession are intricately decorated with beautiful Laaksha patterns.

                                The larvae of the Laksha insect, which inhabits trees like cones, masons, kappetiya, and thalakiriya, are used to make laksha or artificial dyes and Woods like Michelia champaca(Ginisapu), Thespesia populnea ( Gansuriya) and Swietenia mahagoni ( Mahogony), are used to produce Laksha.

                            In the traditional Laksha industry, colors were obtained by mixing Laksha with green and yellow, using Sadilingam. Initially, only red, yellow, and black were the primary colors used. Over time, blue, green, and white were introduced. Today, machine-made dyes like titanium allow for additional colors such as purple, lead, copper, and gold.

                            The device used to make these is called <mark>SPOOL WORK.</mark> Here, a compressed lacquer stick is applied while the object to be decorated is rotated on a lathe. The friction generated by the rotation softens the lac, allowing it to adhere to the object’s surface. This method is suitable for items that can be turned on a lathe, resulting in most of the crafted objects having rounded shapes. Pattal Wada is a unique and specialized technique that adds to the diversity and beauty of Laksha handicrafts.
